# Social Media Crisis Detection System 

A comprehensive pipeline for detecting mental health crises in social media posts using NLP, sentiment analysis, and geospatial mapping.


## Project Overview
This system helps identify at-risk individuals by analyzing social media posts through three key phases:
1. **Data Extraction**: Collects mental health-related posts from Reddit
2. **Risk Assessment**: Classifies posts by sentiment and crisis level
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Maps crisis concentrations and identifies high-risk areas
